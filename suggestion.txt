Applying for both the "Research Scientist" and "Research Developer" positions at the same company can demonstrate your versatility and interest in contributing to different aspects of research and development within the organization. It showcases your eagerness to explore opportunities that align with your skills and interests.

However, it's important to ensure that your application materials, such as your cover letter and resume, are tailored to highlight the specific skills and experiences relevant to each role. This will show that you understand the distinct requirements for each position and are prepared to contribute effectively in either capacity.

Additionally, if the company has a clear distinction between these roles and you believe you have the qualifications and passion for both, applying for both positions can increase your chances of securing an interview and allow you to present yourself as a well-rounded candidate.

Before applying, carefully review the job descriptions for both positions to identify the key skills and responsibilities, and make sure your application materials reflect your suitability for each role.
