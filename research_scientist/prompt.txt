i have the following self introduction:
```
i am an independent agi researcher.

i am passionate about working on open source projects.

i have been working on multiple open source projects, like lazero (utility library), pyjom (media content automation), cybergod (computer HID automation that can completely replace human operators).

i am always excited about new technologies like video generation, semantic search, retrieval augmented generation, and more. i always want to share, understand, and make use of the latest technologies. i challenge myself to make automated media contents, automated computer operator agent.

i often record my unique ideas and implement them step by step. i can think of better solution for the same purpose for a very long time. when the client-side tensorflow.js is infeasible i think of llm generated explaination, summaries and tags. when single turn search is infeasible i think of hierarchical search and key-value store of related words. i am innovative and practical.

i kept my ideas into 500+ notes and ever growing. i almost write everything significant to me and others in them, to remind me about my discoveries, and for my information retrieval system. i posted them as a blog to share my ideas.

i frequently make pull requests and issues to open source projects like jinja2, flexsearch, fd, textualize, etc. i communicate with developers and usually promote my own unique solutions along with my problems.

i created a program that automatically creates documentation for any projects, and an interactive file ignore rules visualizer called vignore to filter out files for documentation generator.

i was hired for one year to build a linear-programming system and facing the challenge of infeasible models. i managed to create a backtracking system and a error-tolerant system to pinpoint the problem. i also think about applying it to the task of long term job management. i was fascinated in creating the grammar of a new modeling language that was more concise and debugable.

i am always working on my own projects, and i am always looking for new challenges. i am a self-taught programmer, and i am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

i believe a fully automatic computer operator like cybergod can truly democrate the computing industry, and i am working on creating a fully automatic computer operator that can be used by anyone.

now i have a job called "Research Scientist" i want to attend. here is the job description:
```
About the Role

As a Research Scientist here, you will develop innovative machine learning techniques and advance the research agenda of the team you work on, while also collaborating with peers across the organization. We are looking for people who want to discover simple, generalizable ideas that work well even at large scale, and form part of a broader research vision that unifies the entire company.

We expect you to:

    Have a track record of coming up with new ideas or improving upon existing ideas in machine learning, demonstrated by accomplishments such as first author publications or projects
    Possess the ability to own and pursue a research agenda, including choosing impactful research problems and autonomously carrying out long-running projects
    Be excited about OpenAIâ€™s approach to research 

Nice to have: 

    Interested in and thoughtful about the impacts of AI technology
    Past experience in creating high-performance implementations of deep learning algorithms
