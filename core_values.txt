Core values:

AGI focus
We are committed to building safe, beneficial AGI that will have a massive positive impact on humanity's future.

Anything that doesn’t help with that is out of scope.

Intense and scrappy
Building something exceptional requires hard work (often on unglamorous stuff) and urgency; everything (that we choose to do) is important.

Be unpretentious and do what works; find the best ideas wherever they come from.

Scale
We believe that scale—in our models, our systems, ourselves, our processes, and our ambitions—is magic. When in doubt, scale it up.

Make something people love
Our technology and products should have a transformatively positive effect on people’s lives.

Team spirit
Our biggest advances, and differentiation, come from effective collaboration in and across teams. Although our teams have increasingly different identities and priorities, the overall purpose and goals have to remain perfectly aligned.

Nothing is someone else’s problem.
